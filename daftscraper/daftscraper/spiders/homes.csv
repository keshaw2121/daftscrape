Number 17 Raglan Road is a stunning, completely refurbished and modernised residence that commands a triple-aspect view, and draws in all available light from every side. Originally built around 1875.

Designed & refurbished by John Meagher of de Blacam & Meagher to, and, with help from a top team of professionals, set about this daunting project. The entire building was completely gutted, with internal floors, walls, windows and roofs removed. Given a clean slate, the walls were insulated and double-glazed windows installed, making it one of those rarities: an energy-efficient Victorian home - though it is Ber-exempt. Underfloor heating systems were installed, negating the need for radiators, thus leaving the walls free for furniture and shelving. The house has also been wired for phone, audio, TV and security system, and there's an interior vacuum system, eliminating the hassle of dragging a Hoover around the house.

Anything that could be salvaged was lovingly restored, including the original cornicing. Anything that couldn't was replaced with an expertly sourced period piece, including the feature fireplaces and beautiful chandeliers. The five bathrooms and two guest WCs are particularly impressive, all laid out in luxurious marble. A team of Italian craftspeople fitted the bathrooms in Calacatta and Jerusalem Gold marble. In an impressive feat of craftsmanship, all the marble slabs have been near-perfectly bookmatched, with incredible results. The handmade cabinetry in the bathrooms was built by John Daly, and he took up the Italian challenge by bookmatching the grain on the timber.

The main entrance has a tiled reception hall with ceiling coving and centre rose, and an inner hall with teak flooring. The large drawingroom and diningroom lead out to a sunroom/winter garden overlooking the rear, with folding doors that can be opened out to create a terrace, and remote-controlled rooflights fitted with rain sensors so they'll automatically close when the weather starts getting a bit Irish.

This property is situated down tree-tunnelled and cottage-lined country roads, away from the hustle and bustle of city life though still within easy reach of all that modern life demands, we found the perfect location.
The idyllic pastoral village of Coill Dubh, with some 700 residents, offers all the essentials for a quiet life: a shop, a national school, a church, a post office and of course a local pub. Yet, lying just 10-30 minutes drive from many of the main towns of County Kildare and less than 40km from Dublin City, it offers easy access to all the attractions of modern life. The community is very well placed in terms of commuting to and from the capital: 
- by car, in 25 minutes to M50 - by regular Bus Eireann service, from the Coill Dubh, bus stop just 2 minutes walk from Hawthorn Manor - by train, from nearby Sallins Station (14km away). 
Indeed, there is a definite air of renaissance in the area with the turnaround in the economy and the Dublin effect reaching beyond the capital. The region is notable for new ventures such as the Runamuck fun run; new amenities such as the colourful new playground at Timahoe; the further development of family attractions like Lullymore Heritage Park; the increasing popularity of mature landmarks like Coolcarrigan House s 15-acre gardens and Irish National Stud s acclaimed Japanese Gardens; and the development of nature reserves and board walks. Coill Dubh itself is a decidedly relaxed setting, surrounded by birdsong-filled hedgerows, verdant farm fields, vast stretches of peatland nature reserves and famous archaeological sites. Its wide-open spaces mean activities like hurling, football, cycling, running and nature walks are popular pastimes.
This truly is a perfect place to experience the quiet of country life without forgoing the wider world. The tranquil banks and hump-backed bridges of the nearby Grand Canal provide ideal settings for leisurely walks. The nature reserves around the area provide a fascinating backdrop to modern life, linking residents to both nature and history.
Living in Coill Dubh will put you at the heart of a vibrant area of County Kildare, with nearby towns including Clane, Naas, Maynooth, Leixlip, Sallins, Kildare and Newbridge; the nearest town Prosperous, a mere five-minute drive away, offers a wide range of shops, caf s, restaurants and pubs. As well as the local Coill Dubh national school, there are three primary schools and a secondary school in Clane, an excellent school in nearby Naas, and Clongowes College is a 10-minute drive. Maynooth University lies just 20 minutes from Coill Dubh village.",22/06/2023,"1,616"

LOCATION:

The house is located in Fanore village, which is the Coast Road between Lisdoonvarna 
and Ballyvaughan. Fanore is on the Atlantic coastline with stunning views over Galway Bay, 
a 3Km sandy beach and is on the edge of the Burren National Park. It is a very popular 
destination for holiday makers, tourists, hill walkers and more recently for surfers and wind 
surfers. The property is close to the local shop, pub & restaurant and a few minutes-walk 
from the lovely sandy beach.
 
The village of Ballyvaughan has plenty of beautiful restuarants, hotels, pubs and shops. It is also very well known for its local Farmers Market which takes place every Saturday. Here you can pick up lots of local crafts as well as local produce such as honey, eggs, fruit and veg and much more. The charming heritage village is an ideal base to explore the many wonders of The Burren and its surrounding countryside. The famous Burren Way (35 km of Green Road) starts in Ballyvaughan and continues onto Fanore, Doolin, Lisdoonvarna and finally Liscannor. There are numerous other walks to take like the Black Head loop or the Carron Loop. They can be easily navigated or can also be taken with a local guide. 

There are many places to explore around Ballyvaughan like Aliwee caves and its fantastic Birds of Prey Centre. Take a tour of the caves, watch one of the amazing Birds of prey shows, sample some of their very own cheese or simply enjoy a spot of lunch in their beautiful café. 
There are plenty of fishing spots along the North Clare coast including Ballyvaughan itself. Bike Hire is also available for anyone looking to explore in a different way.

Rapid Transport Links  
A true neighbourhood, Harold’s Cross is served by multiple bus routes – the 9, 16, 49, 54A and 83 will speed you in to town, the 16 connects to Dublin Airport and a Nightlink service (49N) will get revelers back from that nightclub – but you don’t have to rely on public transport, as the village is so central. An amble into St Stephen’s Green will take around 30 mins and a Dublinbike (or your own bicycle) will get you there in around 10 … about the same it takes to drive to the M50. 

Leading Leisure 
Budding Federers and Serenas will love Rathgar Tennis Club, while the Leinster Cricket and Kenilworth Bowling clubs offer more relaxed recreation. The Swan Leisure complex’s swimming pool is popular with beginners and expert front-crawlers, while Satya Yoga Club provides a calming alternative. Furthermore, the area brims with soccer and rugby clubs, while Bushy Park, Harold’s Cross Park, Eamonn Ceannt Park and the Grand Canal are walkers’ paradises.  


Superb shopping
In the heart of Rathmines is the bustling Swan Shopping Centre, which includes a large Dunnes Stores outlet, Omniplex Cinema (opposite the retro Stella cinema), bookshops, butchers and more. Even more local is Harolds Cross’s handy Centra store, while nearby Kimmage has a superb SuperValu. Hipster-friendly Portobello and South Richmond St are famed for their ethnic food markets, while Grafton Street – just 20-25 minutes walk – brims with big-names stores. 
              
Bustling bars and eateries
An appetiser …
Peggy Kelly’s and the Harold House are friendly “locals”, Rathmines’s lively watering holes include Roddy Bolands and Blackbird, and The Bleeding Horse is a cosmopolitan establishment across the canal. Craft on Harold’s Cross Road and Clanbrassil St’s Konkan Indian restaurant are just two of the acclaimed eateries. Then there’s Five Points Café, Beckett & Bull … 

Excellent schools
Like other well-established Dublin neighbourhoods, Harold’s Cross has plenty of school and childcare options (including crèches) for its residents. The lengthy list of prestigious local primary and secondary schools includes The High School; Alexandra College; Stratford College; St. Louis Primary and High Schools; St. Mary's College; Our Lady's School; and Terenure College. Of course, these are all within easy reach, so lengthy, stressful commutes aren’t necessary.

The apartment is thoughtfully furnished and finished to a high standard with the notable treatment of bespoke interior design solutions, wholly unique to the unit.

The entrance hallway is generously sized with thick carpeting to create an immediate sense of welcome. The interior here utilises a soft tan colour palette and warm lighting, suggestive of the overall comfort and security that the home offers. A large modern mirror hangs above a wide and shallow table, contemporary minimalist in design.

The fully equipped kitchen/dining area features wood-effect tiling and sleek modern workspaces with several high performance appliances. The integrated dishwasher, washer/dryer, oven and ceramic hob are from Beko, the microwave is Teka and the fridge/freezer is Electrolux - all highly efficient. Key in the design of the kitchen is its marriage of vintage and contemporary; it is aesthetically ‘homely’ and almost familiar while it celebrates and accommodates our more modern
lifestyles.

The dining area enjoys the openness and flow from the kitchen while remaining its own intimate setting. The table is elegant with restaurant-style seating such that the space brings all the right majesty to meal-time aided by the bright pop of yellow chairs which really brings the table to life.

The dining area leads on to the main living space where a large stylish rug creates a generous and airy openness among the seating, which includes a matching blue two-seater couch and armchair aswell as a more minimalist and rather stylish mustard single-seater. There is a dedicated work station in the corner of the living area, private and secluded with a comfortable desk and chair, created with modern living in mind. Floor-to-ceiling sliding doors flood the room with natural light, leading out onto a large balcony which runs the length of the room.

The bedroom is designed to champion downtime - a sanctuary of solitude and rest. Thick carpeting and a laid-back colour palette ensure that the room maintains its own relaxed atmosphere, separate to whatever hustle and bustle might lie beyond the door. The bed is large, very comfortable and low-standing and picks up the room’s subtle tones with an attractive wooden trim. This extends to the wardrobe, bedside lockers, chest of drawers and an elegant dressing table to complete the suite. Floor-length curtains will guarantee darkness when required, but the window is thoughtfully positioned to make the most of the morning light.

The uniqueness of Elmville is that the keen eye of the interior designer is evident throughout and the bathroom is no exception. The large bath/shower delightfully features the notorious chic subway tiles, a long standing favourite in practical-meets-pleasing bathroom design.

The apartment is fitted with an intercom system for permission of access from within. The home is heated using an air-source pump and heat-recovery unit, a sensible and modern solution - highly efficient with low running costs.

Parking is available at an additional charge.

More about the location…

Docklands is Dublin’s most vibrant city centre quarter and it’s most cosmopolitan. It’s a cool place to live and Docklands has a great energy thanks, in part, to its young work force and but also a great maritime history. Docklanders are spoiled for choice in terms of bars, cafes, and restaurants including Bread 41, Herbstreet and 3Fe. One Lime Street benefits from an extremely convenient location. It will form part of a new development scheme including a state-of-the-art commercial building: The Shipping Office and next door to Tik Tok's European HQ all of which will see this area come to life once again. Multiple transport options are available, Pearse Street and Grand Canal Dart Stations are both 10-minute walk, as is a Dublin bus stop serving routes to the city centre. There is a Dublin Bikes station right outside the property and another one close by and global tech HQs like Meta and Google are all within walking distance.
